# How to Export Code from Figma Make

**Your Figma Make Link**: https://www.figma.com/make/1Vsp3zX3WsgeQtkDGLwLV9/Mindfulness-App-Design

---

## The Issue

The link you shared is to the **Figma Make viewer**, but I need the **actual generated code files** (React components, CSS, etc.).

Figma Make generates code that needs to be **downloaded** or **copied** from the interface.

---

## How to Export the Code

### Method 1: Download as ZIP (Recommended)

1. **Open your link** in a browser (if not already open):
   - https://www.figma.com/make/1Vsp3zX3WsgeQtkDGLwLV9/Mindfulness-App-Design

2. **Look for a "Download" or "Export" button**
   - Usually in the top-right corner
   - Or in a menu/settings area

3. **Select format**: Choose **React** or **HTML/CSS**

4. **Download the ZIP file**

5. **Share with me**:
   - Upload the ZIP to Google Drive/Dropbox
   - Share the link with me
   - OR extract and paste key files here

### Method 2: Copy Code Directly

1. **In the Figma Make interface**:
   - Select a component/screen
   - Look for a "Code" or "View Code" panel

2. **Copy the generated code**:
   - React component code
   - CSS/styled-components
   - Any theme/token files

3. **Paste it here** in our chat
   - I can work with partial code
   - Start with one screen and we'll iterate

### Method 3: Give Me Edit Access

If the above doesn't work:

1. **Go to your original Figma design file**
   - Not the Figma Make link, but the actual design file

2. **Share it with me**:
   - Click Share in Figma
   - Give "can view" or "can edit" access
   - Send me the file link

3. **I'll generate the code**:
   - I can use Figma API or plugins to extract
   - Or manually convert from the design

## What I'm Looking For

Once you export, I need these files:

### If it's a ZIP file:
```
exported-code/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ JournalScreen.jsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CoachScreen.jsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TimelineScreen.jsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SettingsScreen.jsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AudioWaveform.jsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ EmotionBadge.jsx
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ theme.js (or colors.js)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ typography.js
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ global.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### If pasting code, I need:
1. **At least one screen component** (to see the structure)
2. **Styling information** (CSS, styled-components, or theme file)
3. **Any shared components** you have

## Alternative: Describe Your Design

If you can't export the code, you can also:

1. **Share screenshots** of your Figma designs
2. **Describe the screens**:
   - What's on the Journal screen?
   - What's on the Coach screen?
   - What colors are you using?
   - What fonts/sizes?

3. **I'll build it from scratch** in SwiftUI
   - Using your design as reference
   - Matching it pixel-perfect
